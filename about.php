            <p style="margin-top: 5px">If you've clicked around the website, you probably have a pretty good idea about my skills with a little more insight into who I am. To share some more fun facts about my background, I started photo and video-editing back in 1999. Upon graduating with my Bachelor of Arts degree, I moved to PA and worked as a photo-editor for America's first school portrait company based out of the suburbs of Philadelphia. During that time, I was also selected to participate in the TAPIF program to teach English in France (as referenced by Mean Gene Okerlund in the video on the homepage). In more recent years, I've become somewhat proficient at making full-stack applications and have volunteered helping others learn JavaScript and React for the non-profit organization Code The Dream. As you can tell, I am multi-disciplined and quite agile when it comes to learning and applying new skills. This site will continuously be updated with more work as time goes on-- likely 2D design, photography, and more video production stuff. If you want to check out some of my apps, you can find them over at my other website <a class="site-links" href="https://www.brandonkiefer.net">here</a> which is also planned to receive more updates soon as we head into 2025.</p></br>

                <p>Currently the signup and login components on this site work, and I went through some trouble making sure they actually did, however they don't really serve any purpose at this time. I will likely shift them over to possibly refactor myBikeDatabase to use this PHP and SQL stack rather than the current React/MongoDB stack. Anyways, I hope you enjoy my portfolios. For any questions or comments, you can send me an email at <a class="site-links" href="mailto:KieferStudios@gmail.com">KieferStudios@gmail.com</a></p></br>

            <p>Cheers!</p></br>
            <p>Brandon</p>
