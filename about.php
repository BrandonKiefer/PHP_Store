            <p style="margin-top: 5px">If you've clicked around the website, you probably already have a pretty good idea about my skills and who I am. To share some more fun facts about my background, I started photo and video-editing back in 1999. I previously worked as a photo-editor for America's first school portrait company based out of the suburbs of Philadelphia. In more recent years, I've become somewhat proficient making full-stack applications and have volunteered helping others learn JavaScript and React for the non-profit organization Code The Dream. As you can tell, I am multi-disciplined and quite agile when it comes to learning new things. This site will continuously be updated with more work as time goes on-- likely 2D design and more video production stuff. If you want to check out some of my other apps, you can find them over at my other website <a class="site-links" href="https://www.brandonkiefer.net">here</a> which will also be receiving more updates soon as we head into 2025.</p></br>

            <p>Cheers!</p></br>
