            <p style="margin-top: 5px">I personally consider this to be my best work out of everything I've done in glass and is the result of a triple color overlay and sandblasting. '<i>Gaia (Crying Woman)</i>' is the name Iâ€™ve given it due to its organic and natural colors as well as its 2D sandblasted design displaying the face of a woman with her hand extended as she blows a swirling green mist around the exterior of the glass vessel. I was influenced and inspired by the ancient Greek personification of earth while making this. The innermost color is a beautiful golden canary yellow overlayed by a royal cobalt blue color rod (not actually black as it might appear in the photos) and is covered by a various mix of jade greens.</p></br>

            <p>As you can see in the images above, this was what the piece looked like upon successfully completing the initial process of overlaying the 3 colors. While the blue might appear almost black on the outside- it is much more prominent on the inside of the finished piece as it mixes with the inner yellow color rod to manifest an entirely different tone of gorgeous greens. I also want to highlight the fact that an airbubble got trapped in the shut eye of the finished piece, so that the woman appears to be weeping, is something we like to call a happy accident.</p></br>
