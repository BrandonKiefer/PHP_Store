<h2>No Justice For All...</h2>

Due to unfortunate circumstances in 2023, this piece may be lost to time. I did save a lot of other work made from around this same time period in 2011 but this particular piece still really means a lot to me. That said, I wish I had taken better quality photos of the final angle back when a lot of the other photos on this site were taken. It displays the figure of an old man with his hand out while a meager couple of dollar bills are left lingering in the void around him. This stands in stark contrast to the other side of the piece based on a real photo of a past presidential U.S. administration while they are paraded by dollar bills raining from the sky. Of course, there wouldn't be a contrast between these figures without the iconic image of  lady liberty holding the scales of justice in her blindfold, an image I based on my favorite Metallica album (despite the absence of audible bass on the album)- from which this piece derives its name.

Here are some other photos that I think provide the fullest context to this piece tying it all together. While this work might still be out there somewhere, I'm not going to get my hopes up. It still deserves to be included with my other body of work and perhaps I may decide to recreate it again in the future.</p>
